Excercises from Data Structures and Algorithms course.
Here are exercises carried out that the professor assigned to us during the course.
Some of them are a personal implementation regarding the Data Structutres and Algorithms,
others are only preparatory to some key concepts of object-oriented programming.
However all of them works just fine, for each exercise you can also find the tests in the folder 
and check for yourself that the code works.
